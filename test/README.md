End to end integration tests
============================

This project carries out (almost) the same data transformations in Python as
the main software, and compares the results to see whether we get the same
thing.

As noted in the root README, you have to supply your own data to run the tests
here. Drop in an NMEA file containing AIS data as `raw_data.nmea` and run
`make run-tests`; it'll build all the relevant assets and then run a comparison.

The comparison prints out messages that are missing from either the main
software processed output and the Python processed output; specifically
`decode_output/MESSAGES.ndjson` corresponds to the main software output, and
`sot/data.ndjson` the Python version's.

You may find a few entries here, as the Python-based decode path misses some
of the messages found by the main D path (it's about multipart sentence
joining). You want to look out for messages generated by the Python but not
the D, as except in the case where the latter's fitlered out an AIS null
position (91, 181) that suggests a bug. Please file an issue in the latter
case.
